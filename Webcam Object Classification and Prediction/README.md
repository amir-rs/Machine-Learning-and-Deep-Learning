## Webcam Object Classification and Prediction

### Introduction:
This project aims to facilitate webcam-based object classification and prediction. Users can capture images using a webcam, categorize them into various classes, and subsequently test a trained model to predict objects seen through the webcam feed.

### Features:
- **Image Capture**: Capture images through webcam input.
- **Class Categorization**: Organize captured images into different classes for training.
- **Model Training**: Train a model using the categorized image data.
- **Object Prediction**: Predict objects seen through the webcam using the trained model.

### Usage:
1. **Image Capture**: Run the image capture script to capture images using the webcam.
2. **Class Categorization**: Organize the captured images into different classes by renaming the image files accordingly.
3. **Model Training**: Train a machine learning model using the categorized image data. Various machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, or Keras can be employed for this purpose.
4. **Object Prediction**: Run the object prediction script to predict objects seen through the webcam feed using the trained model.
